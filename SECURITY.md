## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, report vulnerabilities through one of the following private channels:

1. GitHub Security Advisories (preferred)
2. Directly to project maintainers via repository contact methods

When reporting, include:

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Reproduction steps or proof of concept
- Impact assessment
- Suggested remediation if available

You can expect an acknowledgment within a few business days. We will provide
status updates as triage and remediation progress.
